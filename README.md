# Wifi-killer
Shutdown the wifi on your laptop from your main pc using voice command.
# What it does:
You start an online game and you noticed you have a high ping.
Oops you forgot to turn off the wifi on your laptop. Using this program
you can just say to your microphone "akshev" (In hebrew means - "listen") and then "cabe wifi" (In hebrew means - "turn off wifi") and the wifi will toggle off.
once you're done with your game. You will find on the laptop a console. On that
console a click on Enter will toggle the wifi back on.
# How to use it:
Make sure you set the ip address of your laptop on the client side.
Run the server on the laptop you will see a console opens and then closes.
It's not really closed only hidden. Now open the client on your main pc.
And when you say "akshev" (In hebrew means - "listen") and then "cabe wifi" (In hebrew means - "turn off wifi") the wifi on your laptop will toggle off.
That's all you need to make it work.
 
In order to close the client just say "akshev" and then "titabed" (In hebrew means - "kill yourself").
And in order to close the server just enter some text before you press enter. And it will close the server.
# Why I made it:
I made this program because I download on the laptop movies. And most of the times just forgot about it.
While starting a match on CS:GO noticing my high ping. And then having to go mid game to turn off
the wifi really pissed me off. So I decided to create this little program.
