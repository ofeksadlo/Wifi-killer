# Wifi-killer
Shutdown wifi on the laptop from your main pc using voice command.
# What it does:
You start an online game and you noticed you have a high ping.
Oops you forgot to turn off the wifi on your laptop. Using this program
you can just say to your microphone "ten status" and then "Laptop off" and the wifi will toggle off.
once you're done with your game. You will find on the laptop a console. On that
console a click on any button will toggle the wifi back on.
# How to use it:
Make sure you set the ip address of your laptop on the client side.
Run the server on the laptop you will see a console open and then closes.
It's not really closed only hidden. Now open the client on your main pc.
And when you say "ten status" and then "laptop off" the wifi on your laptop will toggle off.
That's all you need to make it work.
# Why I made it:
I made this program because I download on the laptop movies. And most of the times just forgot about it.
While starting a match on CS:GO noticing my high ping. And then having to go mid game to turn off
wifi really pissed me off. So I decided to create this little program.
