# Wifi-killer
Shutdown wifi on the laptop from your main pc.
# What it does:
You start an online game and you noticed you have a high ping.
Oops you forgot to turn off the wifi on your laptop. Using this program
you can just say to your microphone "Laptop off" and the wifi will toggle off.
once you're done with your game. You will find on the laptop a console. On that
console a click on any button will toggle the wifi back on.
# Why I made it:
I made this program because I download on the laptop movies. And most of the times just forgot about it.
While starting a match on CS:GO noticing my high ping. And the having to go mid game to turn off
wifi.
