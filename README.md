# Wifi-killer
Shutdown wifi on the laptop from your main pc.

You start an online game and you noticed you have a high ping.
Oops you forgot to turn off the wifi on your laptop. Using this program
you can just say to your microphone "Laptop off" and the wifi will toggle off.
once you're done with your game. You will find on the laptop a console that
a click on any button will toggle the wifi back on.
